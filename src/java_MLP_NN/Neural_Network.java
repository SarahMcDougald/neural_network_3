 * Created by Sarah on 9/25/2017.
 *
 * GOALS with this version of the project:
 * -- flesh out architecture with pseudocode; THEN fill in with code, once complete
 * -- Use the simplest NN design possible. Save Java's object focus for a later version.
 * -- Get a neural network up and running, in Java.
